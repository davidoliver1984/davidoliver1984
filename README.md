I’m a full-stack developer with over 15 years of freelance and contract experience, working with startups, agencies, and enterprise teams across the UK, Europe, and North America.

My specialty is secure, scalable Laravel development, but my work spans across stacks, from React and WordPress front-ends to .NET and PHP legacy systems. I’ve built training portals, admin dashboards, e-commerce tools and custom CMS/CRM platforms.

I’ve acted as both a lead developer and project manager, mentoring teams, planning sprints, and liaising directly with clients to make sure deadlines are met and systems are future-proof. I’m especially experienced in converting and modernising legacy platforms.

Whether you’re rebuilding a slow, outdated system or launching something new, I bring clean architecture, strong communication and a delivery-first mindset.

I’m currently available for remote contract roles, short-term systems work, or long-term platform consulting
